This is the home page of research HPC software project **Ver**kko-**Hem** (VerHem). 

VerHem is a Finite-Element analysis based high dimension partial differential equations solver suite. The prior target of VerHem is system of Ginzburg-Landau partial differential equations of anisotropic superfluid in the presence of Robin boundary conditions. 

Such type of superfluids and superconductors involve tensor order parameters thanks for their complicated symmetry breaking patterns in addition to spontaneous breaking of U(1) gauge symmetry. As a result, the Ginzburg-Landau effective theory suggest **coupled non-linear** partial differential equations. The traditional strategies to walk around the hardness of solving such equation systems are more or less ansatz-related, or simplifying the equations with specific symmetries. 

Aiming to modeling superfluid Helium-3 liquid, which is p-wave anisotropic superfluid with 18 components in its order parameter tensor, Verhem project is developing modern HPC toolkit to overcome the challenge of direct solving of high-dimension multiple components Ginzburg-Landau equation systems.
